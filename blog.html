                <p>So far I am very much enjoying the Applied Software Engineering course - it echoes much of what I had studied previously at school and is a refreshing recap of the skills I have. I like that I can input techniques and styles that I am
                    already familiar with in different contexts and am excited to be learning binary at the moment. The reason I like this course so much is because I am very excited to work in industry and gain some experience before I graduate so that
                    I am work ready for employment immediately. I have also picked up some new things that I didn't know before the course that I find very useful. I feel the teachers are very useful and friendly and like the positive learning atmosphere
                    that we have over at Newport. All the external speakers have been very informative and i have always left them feeling inspired or with a new understanding. I am always gaged during the lessons... </p><br />

                <p>Kabiras Article The Applied Software Engineering course at Cardiff University has been a constant learning journey for me - having had no former programming experience I find it very useful to makes notes of even the most trivial things
                    such as the syntax of a language. I find I often need the logical foundation or explanation of why a method work in order to grasp an idea and make it ‘stick’. The course so far has also been very informative - it's very hands on and
                    we are producing code every lesson rather than solely listening to somebody talking without any practice or input. The interactivity of the course makes it good particularly for me as i am a kinesthetic learner. The course has been
                    full of positives for me and I enjoy... </p><br />

                <p> Semantics are the implied meaning of a subject, like a word or sentence. It aids how humans (and these days, machines) interpret subject matter. On the web, HTML serves both humans and machines, suggesting the purpose of the content enclosed
                    within an HTML tag. Since the dawn of HTML, elements have been revised and adapted based on actual usage on the web, ideally so that authors can navigate markup with ease and create carefully structured documents, and so that machines
                    can infer the context of the wonderful collection of data we humans can read.</p><br/>

                <p>The Flexbox Layout officially called CSS Flexible Box Layout Module is new layout module in CSS3 made to improve the items align, directions and order in the container even when they are with dynamic or even unknown size. The prime characteristic
                    of the flex container is the ability to modify the width or height of its children to fill the available space in the best possible way on different screen sizes.</p><br />

                <p>Many designers and developers find this flexbox layout easier to use, as positioning of the elements is simpler thus more complex layouts can be achieved with less code, leading to simpler development process. Flexbox layout algorithm
                    is direction based unlike the block or inline layout which are vertically and horizontally based. This flexbox layout should be used for small application components, while new CSS Grid Layout Module is emerging to handle the large
                    scale layouts.</p><br />
